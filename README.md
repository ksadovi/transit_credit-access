# Neighborhood Effects in the Mortgage Approval Process
In this project, I attempt to identify how neighborhood effects impact the likelihood of approval for a residential mortgage. I'll be using public HMDA data as of Aug. 2022. The end goal of this project is a [FEDS Note](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/default.htm).

## Timeline 
- [ ] **Aug.-Sept. 2022** I am using this period to gather a robust literature review (or at least as robust as possible). My aim is to read 3-4 papers per week. I will save each paper in my `Literature` folder, and summarize and document my thoughts in my `Lit Review.docx` file.
